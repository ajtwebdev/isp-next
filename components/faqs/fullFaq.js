              answer="The investment depends on what final images you purchase. Clients spend between $750 to $5,000, depending on wants and funds.. Once you book with us, we pull out all the stops to make this an incredible, luxurious experience.

Note: We offer flexible “layaway” plans to make it possible for anyone to comfortably afford their images. Get in touch to inquire about pricing and layaway options."

              answer="YES! Yes! Mark is a posing genius. He will guide you into flattering poses, showing off your best assets. Most women arrive with some insecurities and nerves. When you start seeing the images on the camera back, they vanish.

Our 40+ years of experience photographing over 5,000 women means we’re skilled at emphasizing what our clients love about themselves and minimizing anything they don’t feel comfortable showing off.

              answer="Yes, most of us have areas of our bodies that we’re just not comfortable showing off. We’re really good at knowing exactly what poses emphasize the parts you’re MOST proud of and deemphasize (or completely cover) the areas you’d rather not show. We also offer light retouching to make sure you’re absolutely thrilled and proud of your final images. "

              question="How much time will this take?"
              answer="Most of our session days last for about three hours. The first hour is hair and makeup in our studio, and the remaining two hours are in front of the camera!  You just need to arrive with a clean face and unstyled hair! "

              answer="Only if you choose to be! Most of our clients come hoping they will be comfortable enough to do nudes. They are thrilled when they are. Usually they do a mix of nudes, lingerie and fashion glamour in their sessions.

              This is your adventure, you dictate what you want, Mark  creates a safe and comfortable environment that frees you. Oh, we have comfy robes for between sets.

              answer="Absolutely! Many of our clients invite a spouse, partner, or friend along. We welcome anyone who will make you feel comfortable. (And bringing a romantic partner makes for a very sexy date…)"

            <AccordionItem
              question="Will my photographs appear on your website or on the internet?"
              answer="No, not unless you give us permission to do so. No one outside of our small Inner Spirit team will see your images. If you are comfortable letting us present some images for contests and marketing, you can sign a model release allowing us to. We are very strict about privacy. Only you decide who sees your photos."

              question="Do you offer retouching or enhancements?"

            <AccordionItem
              question="I’m not sure about working with a male boudoir photographer. Why should I consider it?"
              answer="We completely understand this question and we’re glad you asked! Some clients have found that working with a male boudoir photographer has distinct benefits that they would not experience with a female photographer: Working with a male photographer can make it easier for some women to tap into their sensual side. Some women find that because the male-female dynamic is one they are familiar with when it comes to sensuality, they are able to access that side of themselves easier. 


              Working with a male photographer can facilitate healing for those who have experienced past trauma with a man. Some clients have reported that the experience helped them “rewrite” past traumatic experiences with men because they were able to be in full control of this experience. 
              
              
              Working with a male photographer allows you to get the perspective of what a man finds sexy about you, which may be different from what you assume. This can be especially helpful if you are getting these photos as a gift for a male romantic partner. 
              
              If you are insecure about your beauty or appeal to men, working with a male photographer can be extremely encouraging, as he assures you that you are beautiful, just the way you are (and means it!). While compliments from a woman can be amazing, it can be uniquely validating to receive compliments from a man if you have insecurities in this area.
